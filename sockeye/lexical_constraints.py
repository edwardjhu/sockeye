    Usage: python3 -m sockeye.lexical_constraints [--bpe BPE_MODEL]

    Reads sentences and constraints on STDIN (tab-delimited) and generates the JSON format
    that can be used when passing `--json-input` to sockeye.translate. It supports both positive
    constraints (phrases that must appear in the output) and negative constraints (phrases that
    must *not* appear in the output).

    e.g.,

        echo -e "Das ist ein Test .\tThis is\ttest" | python3 -m sockeye.lexical_constraints

    will produce the following JSON object:

        { "text": "Das ist ein Test .", "constraints": ["This is", "test"] }

    If you pass `--avoid` to the script, the constraints will be generated as negative constraints, instead:

        echo -e "Das ist ein Test .\tThis is\ttest" | python3 -m sockeye.lexical_constraints --avoid

    will produce the following JSON object (note the new keyword):

        { "text": "Das ist ein Test .", "avoid": ["This is", "test"] }

    Make sure you apply all preprocessing (tokenization, BPE, etc.) to both the source and the target-side constraints.
    You can then translate this object by passing it to Sockeye on STDIN as follows:

        python3 -m sockeye.translate -m /path/to/model --json-input --beam-size 20 --beam-prune 20

    Note the recommended Sockeye parameters. Beam pruning isn't needed for negative constraints.
